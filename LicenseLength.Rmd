```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
library(lubridate)
doggos <- read_feather("dogs.feather")
```

The below extracts dates written as characters, turns them into workable date format, then calculates how long the license is good for and adds all those columns to a data frame. Next step could be to find variation in license length by zipcode, dog age, and/or breed.

```{r}
doggos %>%
  mutate(issued = parse_date_time(LicenseIssuedDate, "%m %d %y"),
         expiry = parse_date_time(LicenseExpiredDate, "%m %d %y"),
         i2e = issued %--% expiry, 
         license_duration = as.duration(i2e),  
         license_period = as.period(i2e)) 

# license_duration gives exact seconds with an estimate in years.
# license_period is the same info as license_duration but in a more intelligible format and more granularity 
```
